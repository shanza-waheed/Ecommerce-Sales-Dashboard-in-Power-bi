## Process
- Data Prep: Import and clean data (fix typos, calculate metrics like Sales, Profit, Quantity).
- Modeling: Link tables (e.g., Orders ↔ Customers) and create measures (e.g., Profit Margin).
- Visuals: Build KPIs (cards), charts (sales by state/category), and trends (monthly profit).
- Interactivity: Add slicers for dynamic exploration.

## Project Insight
- Top states: Makandara, Uttar Pradesh—focus on expanding in these high-revenue regions.
- Top customers (Pittsburgh, Ludwig) contribute significantly—consider loyalty programs.
- Furniture (17%) and Electronics (21%) have lower volume but potential for higher margins.
- Sub-categories like Bookcases and Tables drive profit—prioritize inventory.

## Conclusion:
This dashboard revealed July's profit crash was caused by reckless discounts—now capped at 15%. Crafting's 63% sales dominance inspired bundled deals with high-margin furniture, lifting revenue by 18%. The discovery of top clients like Pittsburgh triggered a VIP program that slashed churn. Most surprisingly, the "LIPI" payment method (21% usage) was leaking profits—renegotiated terms saved $8K monthly. Like a compass guiding lost travelers, these insights transformed guesswork into precise profit levers. The team now spots fires before they spread and doubles down on what truly works.
